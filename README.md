This repository documents my personal learning journey in machine learning.

I am using the book *[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Müller & Sarah Guido](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880)* as my primary reference and maintaining this repo to track my understanding through code, experiments, and short notes.

This repository will evolve as my understanding improves.

Before starting with the book get familiar with:
1. Anaconda Environments
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
