This repository documents my personal learning journey in machine learning.

I am using the book *[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Müller & Sarah Guido](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880)* as my primary reference. Along with the book, I am also following the Coursera course *[Applied Machine Learning in Python by University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning)* to strengthen my conceptual understanding and get additional practical exposure.

I am maintaining this repository to track my understanding through code, experiments, and short notes.

This repository will evolve as my understanding improves.
